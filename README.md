# React-Redux Demo

In this demo, I will implement a simple React-Redux application that includes both synchronous and asynchronous reducers. The synchronous reducer will handle the state for a counter, allowing the user to increment by 1, decrement by 1, or add 5 to the counter. The asynchronous reducer will fetch keywords related to programming and render them on the page.

## Synchronous Reducer - Counter

The synchronous reducer for the counter will handle actions to increment, decrement, or add 5 to the counter state. By dispatching actions to the Redux store, the counter state will be updated accordingly.

## Asynchronous Reducer - Fetch Programming Keywords

The asynchronous reducer will fetch programming keywords from an API and render them on the page. This asynchronous action will require the use of middleware such as Redux Thunk to handle side effects such as API calls.

## Implementation

1. Set up the Redux store with the combined reducers for the counter and programming keywords.
2. Create action creators and action types for incrementing, decrementing, and adding 5 to the counter.
3. Implement the synchronous reducer for the counter state.
4. Create an action creator and action type for fetching programming keywords.
5. Implement the asynchronous reducer for fetching programming keywords using Redux ThThunk.
6. Connect the React components to the Redux store using the `connect` function from React-Redux.
7. Dispatch actions to update the counter state and fetch programming keywords within the React components.
8. Render the counter state and programming keywords on the page.

## Conclusion

In this demo, I have showcased the use of synchronous and asynchronous reducers in a React-Redux application. By combining both types of reducers, I can efficiently manage and update the state of our application. Synchronous reducers handle immediate state updates, while asynchronous reducers handle more complex operations that require additional processing, such as fetching data from an API. By leveraging the power of React-Redux, we can build robust and dynamic applications that provide a seamless user experience.
